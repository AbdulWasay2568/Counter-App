# CounterApp

## Overview

CounterApp is a simple React application that showcases basic state management and event handling in React. The app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. The counter is designed to initialize at `0` and return to `0` on page reload or reset. The user interface is built with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement Counter:** Easily increase or decrease the counter value with intuitive buttons.
- **Reset Functionality:** Quickly reset the counter back to `0` with a dedicated reset button.
